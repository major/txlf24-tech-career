## Five tips for a thriving technology career

* * *

Texas Linux Fest 2024

[Major Hayden](https://major.io/)

----

### First time using reveal.js!

> If something breaks,<br>please don't laugh **too** loudly.

🤭

Note:
Trying new things is a worthwhile endeavor from time to time.

----

## Why am I doing this talk?

I mentor a lot of people and they often ask me the same question:

----

_"How can I build a successful career in technology?"_

# 🤔

----

## Who am I?

Worked in tech for 20 years <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Currently focused on RHEL in the public cloud <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Traveled down technical and manager career tracks <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Survived a period of time in information security <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Owner of too many domain names <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

🤫<br>Please don't give me any ideas<br>for more domain names.

(My wife thanks you in advance.)

💕

----

## Have questions?

I love questions. 💕

I promise I'll save time<br>for questions at the end!

---

# Tip #1

* * *

### Align your work<br>with your interests

# 🪢

----

#### It's as simple as it sounds:

Work in roles or on projects that<br>**give you opportunities**<br>to solve problems that match your interests

----

#### Curiosity and interests

It's easier to be more engaged about your work
when it's something that interests you and it's
something you're curious about.

Note:
Coming up with ideas, making other people's ideas real, taking apart someone else's work to test it

----

#### Be open to new interests, too

Sometimes you'll realize that you're interested in something related to what you're working on

----

#### ⚠️ Watch out for passion

I avoid using the word **passion** because it feels awkward when talking about work

Passion makes it difficult to consider new opportunities

----

### On that note...

There are also those times where<br>
you don't seek out the work<br>
**but the work finds you.**

Note:
You need to find a way to be open to new opportunities at any time, including those that you never considered or would consider.

----

### When the work found me:

It all started with a security incident.

----

Password resets were needed,<br>but only for employees who were affected.

Nobody from our team was on the affected list. 😌

----

Somehow, everyone's passwords were reset at 1PM. 😱

We were right in the middle<br>of a serious unrelated outage. 🔥

All of us were suddenly locked out.

----

Luckily, one engineer nearby had cached credentials.

Unfortunately, he had never worked<br>
on this part of our infrastructure before. 🤦‍♂️

----

We piled around his desk looking at log files and giving him lots of instructions.

After a while, everything was running smoothly again.

# 😌

----

I decided to write a strongly worded email<br>to the Chief Security Officer (CSO).

<br>

️☝️ Pro Tip: I do not recommend writing emails when you are angry. <!-- .element: class="smaller" -->

----

📳

Later that evening, my phone dinged.

----

📅

### 7:30 AM meeting 1:1 with the CSO

----

# 😱 🫣

----

He offered me a job in corporate security working on the company's security architecture.

It was a huge promotion.

I would lead a team of three that grew to six.

----

It was one of the best<br>_(and most stressful)_<br>roles I've ever had.

The work aligned with my interests<br>and offered me plenty of room for growth.

_(And I learned how to dress better for work, too.)_ 

----

How did I survive that huge transition?

----

## "Fake it 'til you make it"

Always be open to learning.

You won't be an expert on day one.

The only bad questions<br>are the ones that aren't asked. 😜

----

## The best roles & projects:

Align with and broaden your interests

Fuel your personal and professional growth

Sometimes find you!

_(Be open to those!)_

---

# Tip #2

* * *

### Cut a path for others to follow

# 🚶‍♂️

----

## Tribal knowledge

That information that every company has<br>
but refuses to write down<br>
in an easily consumable way.

----

## Tribal knowledge

Stratifies teams

Slows down development and testing

Limits career growth<br>
_(Yes, it does)_

----

# 🔮

There was once an engineer who was "the oracle" for nearly every Linux problem known to mankind.

----

# 🧙‍♂️

You could ask him about a problem, he'd ask you a few questions back, and he somehow always knew the solution.

----

Our desks were near each other, so I asked him questions and heard other people ask about things.

He always took time to answer them, but there was one thing that upset him every time:

# 😠

----

# 🔥

### When someone asked him<br>the same question twice.

----

I started writing down questions I asked and the questions I heard others ask.

I wrote down his clarifying questions<br>and the answers he gave.

----

That turned into a basic Wordpress blog where I documented the problems and solutions.

🎉 Still going today, 17 years later! <!-- .element: class="smaller" --> [major.io](https://major.io)

----

Eventually "the oracle" asked me a question:

### _"Did you start that blog with all the stuff people asked me?"_

# 🫣

----

# 🫂

> "Thank you for doing that.<br>I love answering questions for people, but I'm so stressed because I can't finish my work.<br>That takes a big weight off me."

----

## Spreading knowledge:

Feels good for people who share and receive it.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Breaks down barriers. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Opens up career opportunities for everyone. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

### Spread experience the same way

Mentors use experience and knowledge<br>to lift others up to the next level.

Everyone can be a mentor for someone<br>at any stage in their career.

----

## Cutting a path

Share knowledge and experience with others in an easily consumable way.

Mentor others and be mentored.

Build a well-worn path for others to follow.

---

# Tip #3

* * *

### Speak up!

# 📣

----

### A wise manager once asked me:

What is the <br>**most valuable thing**<br> you can give someone?

----

# ⏳

# Your time

----

## Your time

Is your most valuable asset.

Cannot be bought with more money. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Is something that only you can protect. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

Suffering in silence while your time wastes away

#### **is one of the worst things on Earth!**

(But most of us do this fairly often.)  <!-- .element: class="smaller" -->

----

## How do we make this better?

Speak up to defend your time!

----

## Block time in your calendar

For meals.

For learning.

For non-work hours.

For reviewing documents.

For those moments where<br>you need a break to breathe.

----

## Handle meeting invitations with contempt

Just kidding. 🤭

(But not really.)

----

## Meeting invitations

* * *

_No agenda included?_

**Ask for an agenda.** <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

## Meeting invitations

* * *

_More than 3 people are invited?_

Ask why you need to be present and ask what experience or perspective you are expected to provide. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
If they say they want you there to listen, just ask for a copy of the notes or slides to review later.

----

## Meeting invitations

* * *

_Have a conflict at that time?_

Delegate to someone in your team to take your place. It could be a great growth opportunity for someone if you are senior to them! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

## Meeting invitations

_Still don't want to go?_

Then decline the invitation! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

## Efficient aynchronous communication

When you ask someone for something asynchronously (Slack, e-mail, etc),
give them everything they need to write a meaningful reply with **less back-and-forth.**

----

## Don't ask to ask, just ask!

Avoid this:

```text
<them> Can I ask you a question?
~~ lots of time passes ~~
<me> Sure, what?
~~ a weekend passes ~~
<them> When do we need to finish that proposal?
```

Check out  <!-- .element: class="smaller" -->
[nohello.net](https://nohello.net)

----

## Don't ask to ask, just ask!

Do this:

```text
<them> We're meeting with XYZ Bank to share that
       hosting proposal on Friday. When does it
       need to be ready for the internal review?
~~ lots of time passes ~~
<me>   Wednesday by end end of the day. Let's meet
       tomorrow at lunch to finish it up.
```

----

### Tell people as early as possible if:

Something is blocking you from delivering on time

You're unsure of what you need to deliver

There's a chance you'll deliver something late

----

## Speaking up

* * *

Protect your time. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Communicate concisely. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Communicate early. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

# Tip #4

* * *

### Take care of yourself

# 🌴

----

Just like protecting your time,<br>you are the only person<br>who can defend your work/life balance.

# 🤟

----

Find some hobbies that you enjoy.

Get some exercise.

Read books.

----

I love reading about history and other complex topics to better understand cultures and traditions.

Some of these even give me new ideas<br>for strategies at work.

----

# 📻

Amateur (ham) radio is a great way to mix technology with communication.

----

# 🏃‍♂️

My calendar has time blocked at lunch for me to run.

(It keeps me out of the kitchen.) 😜

----

# 🏄‍♂️

Companies give you time off for a reason.

Be sure to use it!

---

# Tip #5

* * *

### Build a path to "yes"

# 🤝

----

### A path to "yes"

Helps other people meet their goals <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Ensures their changes meet your requirements <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Makes others feel that you are vested in their success <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

## Example

You work on a security team and developer needs to deploy a new application.

However, the application doesn't meet the company's secure development requirements.

----

### Instead of saying no...

_"Here's a static security scan tool to go through your application for security issues."_

_"I see a problem here. This team had the same problem. They can help you solve it."_

_"We can make an exception for the beta, but the GA version needs this change."_

----

It's all about finding middle ground and<br>
working under the assumption that <br>everyone has the best intentions.

----

Sometimes it means getting to<br>what someone really needs<br>and avoiding the [X/Y problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem).

----

### X/Y problem

```text
<them> How do I get the last 3 characters
       of the file name? 👋

<me>   Hmm, just the last three? Or are you
       looking for the file extension,
       like JPG or PDF? 🤔

<them> Yes, that's what I need! The extension! 👏

<me>   Okay, good, because not all extensions
       are three characters long! 😜 Let me
       send you some sample code...
```

----

A path to "yes" does not mean<br>becoming a yes-man or yes-woman.

* * *

That's not helpful to anyone.

----

It means remembering the goal of why you come to work everyday: the customers.

Find a way to deliver the best possible experience<br>for your customers by<br>enabling others to do their best work.

----

Look for the win-win outcomes.

---

## Five tips:

1. Align your work with your interests

2. Cut a path for others to follow

3. Speak up!

4. Take care of yourself

5. Build a path to "yes"
